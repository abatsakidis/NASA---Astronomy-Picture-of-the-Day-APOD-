## Description ##

The app will download and display NASA's wonderful Astronomy Picture of the Day (APOD for short) for any date since the launch of the program in 1995. The app will also preserve some user settings from one session to the next. That's important because there's a limit to the number of downloads that can be done in any one day (currently it's 50). We want our app to be aware of this limit and not suddenly fail on our users.<br>
<br>

## How To ##

* Run the program
